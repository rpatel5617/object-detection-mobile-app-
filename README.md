# 📱 Object Detection Mobile App

**Technologies:** Java, TensorFlow Lite, Android Studio  

---

## 🧠 Overview
This project is an **Android mobile application** developed in **Java** that performs **real-time object detection** using **TensorFlow Lite**.  
The app identifies objects captured through the device’s camera and classifies them into predefined categories.  

The main idea behind this project was to build a **base detection system** that can be used in future mobile development — such as smart assistants, surveillance, or automation apps — where real-time object identification is essential.

## ⚙️ Functional Workflow

1. **Model Integration:**  
   - A pre-trained **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)** object detection model was integrated into the Android application.  
   - The model was optimized for mobile use to achieve high speed and low latency.

2. **Camera Feed Processing:**  
   - The app continuously captures live camera frames.  
   - Each frame is analyzed by the TFLite model to detect and classify visible objects.

3. **Real-Time Detection:**  
   - The identified objects are highlighted on the screen with bounding boxes and labeled with confidence scores.  
   - Results update dynamically as the camera moves.

4. **Purpose:**  
   - This project was developed as a **proof-of-concept** app — a building block for future mobile AI systems that require embedded object recognition capabilities.
